This is a text adventure engine that rather than a parser uses keywords and drop-down menus you can click on to progress the story. It's a hybrid of a text adventure and a visual novel.

This was originally being developed for an e-reader (with e-ink, I had an iRex whose screen has since died) which wouldn't cope well with typing but now I plan to release it for Android (and obviously, for Linux on which it's developed). It's using SDL and even has defines for windows as well so if anyone can be bothered it should probably compile for that as well. And since e-readers nowadays run Android anyway maybe I can get it to run there as well.

Code GPL, everything else CC.
